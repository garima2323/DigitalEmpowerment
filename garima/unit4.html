                <p><em>By Garima (2024ZOO1032)</em></p>
                
                <p>In a world where online learning and teamwork are increasingly common, digital communication and collaboration tools have become essential for students. A recent survey of 18–24-year-old students reveals how these tools are being used, the issues students face, and their openness to learning more.</p>
                
                <h4>Communication Habits</h4>
                <p>WhatsApp stands out as the most commonly used communication tool, followed by Email, Telegram, and social media platforms. Most students use these platforms a few times a week, while a few engage with them daily.</p>
                
                <h4>Preferred Platforms for Communication:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>WhatsApp: Quick group chats, coordination.</li>
                    <li>Google Meet / Zoom / Email: Used for formal or scheduled academic communication.</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Teams: Used by some for online classes or meetings.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Collaborative Tools in Use</h4>
                <p>An overwhelming majority have used Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, showing that these tools are central to academic teamwork. Students reported using them mainly for group assignments and academic projects.</p>
                
                <h4>Participation in Online Learning Platforms</h4>
                <p>Platforms like Google Classroom and Coursera were commonly mentioned:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Coursera is popular for individual skill development beyond the regular curriculum.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Challenges in Digital Collaboration</h4>
                <p>The most frequently reported issue was poor internet connectivity, affecting participation and productivity. Other challenges included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of participation from team members.</li>
                    <li>Difficulty understanding the tools for some students.</li>
                    <li>A few students reported no major challenges, showing varied experiences.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Value of Digital Skills</h4>
                <p>Most students rated digital collaboration as very important or extremely important to their education and future careers. They recognize the need to master these skills to succeed in both academic and professional environments.</p>
                
                <h4>Interest in Training</h4>
                <p>While some students feel confident, many expressed interest in receiving training to improve their digital collaboration abilities. Even those who rated their skills as high were open to further learning opportunities.</p>
                
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>This survey highlights that students are actively using digital tools and understand their importance. However, infrastructure issues and collaboration challenges persist. With better access, targeted training, and support from educational institutions, students can further enhance their digital communication and teamwork skills—an essential asset in today's connected world.</p>
